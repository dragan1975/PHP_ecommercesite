# PHP_ecommercesite
This is an ecommerce site worked out as a part of procedural PHP test.
This is a group effort and I have participated in writing a greate deal of code,
especially the parts concerning the functions for users and articles.
The site is almost exclusively procedural, with the exception of using PDO for
accessing database. 
It is fully functional with both frontand and backend parts.
